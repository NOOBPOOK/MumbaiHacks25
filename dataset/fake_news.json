    "news": "Pakistan’s Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, in a public embarrassment, has been caught passing off a 2019 image of exercises being carried out by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, as evidence of “Pakistan’s operational success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos” against India. As per a press release by the Inter-Services Public Relations, the media wing of the Pakistan Armed Forces, at a dinner event held by Pakistan Field Marshal Munir “to honour the political leadership, steadfast commitment of the Armed Forces, and the indomitable spirit of the people of Pakistan,” he gifted a framed picture to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif showing rockets being launched. ‘Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos’ reads the title below the image, while the caption below that describes an operation by the Regiment of Pakistan Artillery. The Pakistan Army named its retaliation to India’s Operation Sindoor as ‘Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. What comes off as odd is the picture’s striking resemblance to an earlier image available on the website of China’s Ministry of Defence. The 2019 image by Chinese military displays a night raid exercise of long-range multiple launch rocket systems in northwest China. While China’s image contains only a singular rocket launcher prominently in the frame, the picture being presented by Mr. Munir to Mr. Shehbaz prominently shows at least three launchers operating simultaneously. However, only a cursory glance at both the images reveal the same exact background showing a large plume of smoke behind the Chinese launcher and the purported Pakistani launchers.",

And shops accepting cash could get hit with £500 fines! 🛑 Every cash transaction will be logged, tracked and linked to your identity 🔍 — so no more “anonymous payments.” They’re calling it the “Secure Commerce Regulation” — basically a move to control all spending, watch where people buy what, and kill privacy forever. 😡 Don’t wait — tell everyone now to use cash wisely and share this message before it’s too late!!! 📢 (Note: this claim is false and not based on any real legislation.)"
